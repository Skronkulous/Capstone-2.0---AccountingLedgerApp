Accounting ledger is an application that allows the user to add a deposit, make a payment, check the ledger, and exit when finished.
The ledger screen provides users with the ability to review all their transactions and apply filters based on transaction type.
Both payments and deposits utilize the Transaction class, requiring input for date, time, description, vendor, amount, and transaction type.
